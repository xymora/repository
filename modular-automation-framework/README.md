# 🧠 Modular Automation Framework for Intelligent Workflow Optimization

This project implements a modular automation framework that allows intelligent agents to dynamically reconfigure workflows based on real-time environmental inputs. It simulates modular decision logic that adapts to operational contexts.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a flexible system where intelligent modules assess environmental conditions and activate corresponding actions, forming the foundation for adaptive and autonomous industrial automation.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Modular architecture for environmental input mapping
- Rule-based evaluation logic with threshold adaptation
- Real-time reconfiguration of automation steps
- Data logging of input-triggered decisions

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy

## 🚀 Pipeline

1. Define automation modules linked to environmental sensors  
2. Generate input matrix simulating 20 time-step events  
3. Use rule-based logic to evaluate sensor thresholds  
4. Log which modules activate in response to each input  
5. Save decision records for analysis or monitoring integration

## 📊 Outputs

- `workflow_decisions.csv`: binary activation log for each module and time step  
- `environment_inputs.csv`: input values for heat, load, and flow sensors

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Replace rule-based logic with machine learning policies  
- Integrate MQTT/WebSocket to receive live environmental input  
- Add GUI for monitoring and manual override of modules
