# 💰 Dynamic Pricing Model for Online Retail

This project implements a real-time pricing strategy for online retail by leveraging demand elasticity, competitor pricing, and current inventory levels. The model aims to dynamically adjust product prices to maximize sales while avoiding overstock or understock situations.

## 🎯 Objective

To predict short-term demand response based on price differences and inventory levels, allowing retailers to optimize pricing decisions using regression-based modeling.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Elasticity modeling with linear regression
- Feature engineering: price gap, inventory level
- Forecasting of near-future demand
- Simulation of new price points and predicted sales
- Visual analysis of price sensitivity

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (LinearRegression, R² Score)
