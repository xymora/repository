# 🧠 Supervised Learning Engine for High-Dimensional Data

This project implements a supervised learning engine designed to classify high-dimensional datasets containing embedded noise and uncertainty. It uses ensemble methods for robustness and incorporates dimensionality reduction for insightful visualizations.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a robust classification model that can handle noisy and complex data environments, with strong generalization ability and meaningful visual feedback.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Random Forest classification
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction
- Confusion matrix and ROC curve evaluation
- ROC AUC scoring for model reliability
- Noise-tolerant training and testing

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## 🚀 Pipeline

1. Load the high-dimensional dataset  
2. Split into training and testing sets  
3. Fit a Random Forest classifier  
4. Generate evaluation metrics (precision, recall, f1-score, ROC AUC)  
5. Plot the confusion matrix and ROC curve  
6. Apply PCA and project the data into 2D space for visualization

## 📊 Outputs

- `confusion_matrix.png`: 2D matrix showing model predictions vs actuals  
- `roc_curve.png`: ROC curve with computed AUC value  
- `pca_projection.png`: Scatter plot of PCA-projected data colored by class  
- Printed classification report and AUC in console

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Replace Random Forest with gradient boosting or deep neural networks  
- Add noise-detection or outlier filtering preprocessor  
- Enable real-time prediction via API or streaming source
