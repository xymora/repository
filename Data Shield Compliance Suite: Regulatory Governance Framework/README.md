# Data Shield Compliance Suite: Regulatory Governance Framework

## Overview
This project provides a robust, high-level simulation of a Data Governance engine focused on **Regulatory Compliance**. It automates the detection of PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and evaluates data handling against **GDPR** and **LFPDPPP** frameworks.

## Key Features
* **PII Discovery:** Automated scanning of datasets for sensitive fields.
* **Compliance Scoring:** Quantitative risk assessment based on encryption and data retention.
* **Decision Dashboard:** Professional visualizations for C-Level reporting.
* **Data Lineage Simulation:** Tracking how data flows through regulatory checkpoints.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script to generate the audit report and dashboard.

## Standards Applied
* **GDPR:** Right to be forgotten, data minimization, and encryption.
* **LFPDPPP:** Consent management and ARCO rights compliance.
