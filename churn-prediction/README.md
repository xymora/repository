# 🔄 Churn Prediction Model

This project builds a supervised machine learning system to identify high-risk clients and trigger retention actions, reducing customer loss in subscription-based services.

## 🎯 Objective

To accurately predict which customers are likely to cancel their subscription, using behavioral, financial, and support-related features, and to compare two classification algorithms to select the most effective one.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Logistic Regression and XGBoost Classifiers
- Feature scaling, encoding, and engineering
- Model evaluation: ROC-AUC, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualizations: confusion matrices and ROC curves
- Result export: churn probabilities and predicted labels

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, xgboost
