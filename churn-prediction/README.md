# 🔄 Churn Prediction Model

This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model to identify customers at high risk of churn in subscription-based services. The goal is to anticipate client attrition and enable proactive retention strategies.

## 🎯 Objective

To accurately predict which customers are most likely to cancel their subscription using historical behavioral, transactional, and demographic data.

## 🧠 Key Techniques

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using Logistic Regression and XGBoost
- Evaluation with metrics like ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
- Feature importance and interpretability with SHAP
- Exporting predictions and scoring outputs

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, xgboost
- shap (model interpretability)
