# 🔄 Churn Prediction Project with Business Collaboration

This repository showcases a churn prediction system developed through simulated collaboration between data science and business stakeholders. It includes documentation, modeling, and interpretation aligned with business impact.

## 🎯 Objective

To identify customers at risk of churn using predictive modeling techniques and translate model outcomes into actionable business decisions that optimize retention efforts.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Logistic Regression for binary classification  
- Feature selection and encoding  
- Evaluation using metrics aligned to retention costs  
- Business-informed thresholding

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.10  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook
