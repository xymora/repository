# AeroGovernance Pro: Data Governance & Analytics Framework
## Strategic Passenger Insights and Operational Resilience (2021-2025)

### Project Overview
This project establishes a high-level Data Governance (DG) framework tailored for the aviation industry. It demonstrates the complete lifecycle of data, from secure ingestion to the generation of executive-level decision-making dashboards. The focus is on maintaining high data quality standards, privacy compliance, and actionable business intelligence.

### Governance Core Pillars
* **Data Integrity & Quality:** Automated cleaning protocols and validation of flight metrics to ensure a "single source of truth."
* **Privacy & Compliance (GDPR/PII):** Implementation of data masking for sensitive passenger information (ID and Names).
* **Operational Transparency:** Real-time monitoring of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as NPS (Net Promoter Score) and arrival delays.

### Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.9+
* **Core Libraries:** Pandas (Data Engineering), Plotly, Requests (API/Remote Ingestion).
* **Architecture:** HTML5 Responsive Dashboard.

### Implementation Instructions
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Execute the main script: `python airline_governance.py`.
3. The interactive dashboard will automatically launch in your default web browser.
