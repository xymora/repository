# 🤖 Adaptive Simulation Framework with Reinforcement Logic

This project implements an adaptive simulation framework using reinforcement learning logic to optimize agent behavior across a dynamic, state-based environment.

## 🎯 Objective

- Q-learning algorithm for behavior optimization
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
- Learning rate and discount factor tuning
- Cumulative reward tracking and convergence analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- matplotlib

## 🚀 Pipeline

1. Define a linear state space and discrete action set  
2. Initialize a Q-matrix for action-value tracking  
3. Execute episodes using an epsilon-greedy strategy  
4. Apply reinforcement updates using the Q-learning formula  
5. Collect and plot episode reward history for convergence tracking

- Learned Q-matrix stored in memory during execution  
- Reward trend showing adaptation over time

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Expand environment to 2D or continuous domains  
- Add stochastic transitions and delayed rewards  
- Integrate agent framework with OpenAI Gym for benchmark testing
