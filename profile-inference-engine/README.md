# 🔍 Profile-Based Inference Engine for Multi-Source Risk Assessment

This project implements a rule-based inference engine that integrates user profiles, financial history, and behavioral event data to categorize individuals into risk levels. It uses a deterministic logic model for transparent and auditable assessments.

## 🎯 Objective

To fuse multiple data sources and apply rule-based logic for automated risk classification across a diverse population of users, enabling use in financial services, cybersecurity, or insurance.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Data integration from three independent structured sources  
- Rule-based scoring system with contextual logic  
- Risk tier classification into Low, Moderate, and High  
- Output generation for downstream dashboards or audits

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- CSV data sources (SQL-ready design)

## 🚀 Pipeline

1. Load user profiles, financial history, and risk event logs  
2. Merge data into a unified frame using UserID  
3. Apply scoring logic based on rule-matching over thresholds  
4. Assign users to one of three risk categories  
5. Export merged dataset for further inspection or use

## 📊 Outputs

- `inference_risk_output.csv`: contains user records with final `RiskCategory`  
- Printed distribution summary: count of users per risk class

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Replace rule-based logic with ML classifiers for pattern learning  
- Add anomaly detection to flag outliers or manipulation  
- Integrate with SQL pipelines or REST API for real-time scoring
