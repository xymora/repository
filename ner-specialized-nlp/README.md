# 🧠 Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Specialized Contexts

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system using spaCy in a specialized domain, targeting entities like medicines, cities, and institutions.

## 🎯 Objective

To identify and classify named entities from unstructured text related to domains such as healthcare, geography, or organizations.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Custom entity tagging
- Data annotation simulation
- Training spaCy NER model
- Visualization using displacy
- Evaluation of model accuracy and F1-score

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.10
- spaCy
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (optional)
- matplotlib / seaborn

## 🚀 Pipeline

1. Annotate or load dataset with labeled entities
2. Preprocess and convert data to spaCy format
3. Train or fine-tune NER model
4. Visualize sample entities
5. Evaluate performance using precision, recall, and F1-score

## 📊 Outputs

- Trained model artifacts
- Visualization of entity recognition
- Metrics from evaluation

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add real annotations with Prodigy or manual tagging
- Use transformers for improved accuracy
- Expand to multilingual entity recognition
