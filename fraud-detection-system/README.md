# 🔐 Fraud Detection System for Digital Transactions

This project implements an unsupervised fraud detection engine using anomaly detection and behavioral modeling to identify suspicious digital transactions and reduce financial risk in e-commerce environments.

## 🎯 Objective

To detect fraudulent patterns in transaction behavior using isolation-based anomaly detection and compare these predictions with labeled data, simulating a real-time fraud screening system.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Evaluation with classification report
- Visualization of anomaly distribution

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (IsolationForest, classification_report)
