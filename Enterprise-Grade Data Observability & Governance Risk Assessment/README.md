# Enterprise Data Governance: Observability & Risk Assessment Framework

This repository contains a high-level Data Governance framework (Core Standards 2021-2025) designed to automate data quality auditing and strategic decision-making through statistical observability.

## Overview
In high-stakes environments, data governance must transcend simple validation. This framework implements "Quality Gates" based on statistical drift and anomaly detection to protect downstream BI and ML assets.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **Data Completeness**: Monitoring missing values across critical dimensions.
* **Statistical Integrity**: Identifying outliers that could bias financial forecasting.
* **Governance Decision Logic**: Automated status reporting (Pass/Warning/Fail).

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Core Libraries**: Pandas, Seaborn, Scipy, Matplotlib.
