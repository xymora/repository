# 🧠 LLM-Based Text Generator with GPT-2 Fine-Tuning

This project implements a complete pipeline to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on custom text data for generating coherent and personalized text outputs. It includes model training, evaluation, generation interface, and export of the fine-tuned model.

## 🎯 Objective

To create a fully functional and extensible system for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2 on domain-specific data and using it to generate interactive text responses.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Pre-trained transformer loading (`GPT-2`)
- Dataset loading and tokenization
- Fine-tuning via causal language modeling (CLM)
- Interactive text generation
- Saving and reloading of fine-tuned model
- Result analysis and perplexity reporting

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Datasets (HuggingFace)
- PyTorch

## 🚀 Pipeline

1. Load and clean domain-specific text data  
2. Tokenize using GPT-2 tokenizer  
3. Fine-tune GPT-2 using causal language modeling objective  
4. Save and reload fine-tuned model  
5. Generate text responses from input prompts  
6. Export generated text for evaluation

## 📊 Outputs

- `generated_text_example.txt`: generated text file from sample prompt  
- Saved model and tokenizer in `fine_tuned_gpt2_model/` directory  

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Integrate FastAPI-based endpoint for generation  
- Add streamlit interface for interactive demo  
- Include BLEU/ROUGE/F1 metric evaluation
