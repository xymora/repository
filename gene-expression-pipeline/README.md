# 🧬 Gene Expression Analysis Pipeline in R

This project implements a bioinformatics pipeline in R for gene expression analysis using microarray-style data and metadata. It supports diagnostic research by identifying differentially expressed genes and visualizing the results.

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze expression differences between conditions (e.g., control vs treatment) and identify biologically meaningful genes for downstream diagnostics and interpretation.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Data normalization and transformation
- Differential expression analysis via DESeq2
- Volcano plot for visualizing statistical significance vs fold change
- Heatmap clustering of significantly expressed genes

## 🛠️ Technologies

- R (base)
- DESeq2
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- pheatmap

## 🚀 Pipeline

1. Load gene expression matrix and sample metadata  
2. Create DESeq2 dataset object and define model design  
3. Run differential expression analysis  
4. Filter genes with adjusted p-value < 0.05  
5. Generate volcano plot for fold change and significance  
6. Create heatmap of top significant genes

## 📊 Outputs

- Summary of significantly expressed genes  
- `volcano_plot.png`: log2 fold change vs -log10(p-adj)  
- Interactive heatmap showing expression patterns

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Integrate RNA-seq count matrix from external alignment tools  
- Allow selection of top N genes for targeted diagnostics  
- Export results in standard formats (TSV, Excel)
