# 📦 Supply Chain Demand Sensing System

This project implements a real-time demand sensing model to optimize inventory levels and reduce holding costs in logistics operations. By leveraging daily demand signals, the system supports proactive stock adjustments based on predictive trends.

## 🎯 Objective

To predict next-day product demand using historical transaction data and enable just-in-time inventory adjustments that reduce excess stock and avoid stockouts.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Moving average smoothing for noise reduction
- Linear regression for short-term demand forecasting
- Per-product modeling using historical daily demand
- Inventory signal analysis (stock, price, lead time)
- Export of predicted demand for operational integration

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (LinearRegression)
